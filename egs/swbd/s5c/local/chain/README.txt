there are a lot of tuning experiments here.

ones to look at right now:
  2y is a TDNN baseline
  4f is a good jesus-layer system
  4q is an improved TDNN with various bells and whistles from Vijay.
  4r is a slightly-better jesus-layer system than 4f, with one more layer.
  5e is the best configuration run so far.
